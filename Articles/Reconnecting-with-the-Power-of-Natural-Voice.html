<header><h2>Reconnecting with the Power of Natural Voice</h2></header>
<p>I want to reconnect with the power of my natural, authentic voice.</p>
<p>Freeing my natural voice is a path that leads to reconnecting wiht my authentic self, which is what I have been trying to do for more than 2 decades living in the United States.</p>
<p>I have tried cognitive behavioral therepy, overcoming social anxiety, taking voice lessons, singing lessons, advanced public speaking,communication and acting classes, dating and pickup, meetups, festivals, social clubs. None of these activities got me the fulfillment i was seeking.</p>
<p>I have accumulated great wisdom from the journey of spiritual healing and transformation and how to reconnect wiht my natural voice in a gradul, gentle and loving way, and I believe sharing insights on how to do that will be great value to other people.</p>
<p>When we are truly in touch with the power of our voice, speaking becomes joy and medicine. Anything you talk about can be joy for you and medicine for other people. This is what I am currently striving to accomplishby working on my own voice
<p>By making youtube vidoes i'll be able to document my own process of reconnecting wiht my natural voice and authentic self becuase I am still in the process of regaining my voice</p>
<p>As I become more comfortable with my own voice, I am hoping to connect to people beyond words. I am hoping to express myself with that kind of energy that will speak to people on a soul level. I want to embody truth, love and beauty of creation and speak with the energy that will communicate all the values that I want to embody and share</p>
