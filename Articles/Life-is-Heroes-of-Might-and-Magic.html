<p>What was so awesome about the Heroes of Might and Magic IIIthat made us so exicted and wnting to play it when we were kids?</p>
<p>Collecting delicious, sparkling jewels, crstals, gold and chests. Learning new magical spells. Having your own castle, upgrading builings, recruiting and upgraing army units, collecting resources and taking over mines.</p>
<p>Battling mosters and other players for expirience and rewards, taking over castles, magical spells, leveling up the hero, finding and collecting arctifacts</p>
<p>Life is Heroes of Might and Magic. We're all in a super advanced journey, think through your moves carefully, you only have so much time in a day.</p>
<p>Strategically position your army and spend your recources wisely. Upgrade your talents, skills, level up and gain wisdom and expirence by completing quests. Defeat monsters gaurding treasure and resource mines.</p>
<p>Only then you will gain true wisdomthat will allow you to learn higher level magical abilities and skills. Make sure your castle is well gaurded, but at the same time don't just sit in your home all the time, go out on adventures and explore the world, thats how you become stronger, wiser and find all the giftes and arctifacts waiting for you</p>
<p>And don't forget about the "holy grail", put the peices of the puzzle together and relize what it actually is, keep digging until you find it, it's the ultimate prize</p>
